* Be transparent: Provide clear and honest information about products, services, and policies.

Once trust and respect are established with customers, it is important to maintain it over time. To do so, customer service representatives should:

* Regularly check in with customers to ensure satisfaction and address any new concerns.
* Provide proactive communication to keep customers informed about any changes or updates.
